# `Sketching with Processing`

### This repo is dedicated to publish my sketches using the [Processing](https://processing.org/ "Processing") library for Java, which allows you to draw 2D/3D graphics and animations. 

***(I have another repo for my sketches using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/), that you can access [here](https://github.com/renans2/sketching-with-p5js)).***

> Many of the ideas for the sketches were inspired by [Daniel Shiffman](https://x.com/shiffman)'s work published on his [Youtube channel: The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain).
